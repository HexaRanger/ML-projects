Rain Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The model is built using various supervised learning algorithms, aiming to provide accurate predictions and insights into weather patterns.

Objectives
Predict rainfall for the next day using historical weather data.
Explore and preprocess the dataset for effective model training.
Compare multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
Handle class imbalance in the data to improve prediction reliability.
Dataset Description
Source: Australian weather dataset (weatherAUS.csv).
Size: 145,460 rows and 23 columns.
Features:
Categorical: Location, Wind Direction, RainToday, etc.
Numerical: MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, WindSpeed, Humidity, Pressure, etc.
Target Variable: RainTomorrow (binary classification: Yes/No).
Technologies and Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
Preprocessing: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using statistical imputation techniques.
Categorized features into numerical, discrete, continuous, and categorical.
Encoded categorical features using appropriate methods (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized correlations between features using heatmaps.
Analyzed patterns and trends in weather conditions affecting rainfall.
Feature Engineering:

Identified and selected relevant features for the model.
Applied normalization and scaling to enhance model performance.
Model Building:

Implemented and compared various algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
CatBoost
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Handled class imbalance using SMOTE to oversample the minority class.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Results
The ensemble model (Random Forest and XGBoost) demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting rainfall.
Class imbalance handling significantly improved recall for the minority class (RainTomorrow = Yes).
Achieved a balance between precision and recall, making the model suitable for practical use.
Conclusion
This project successfully applied machine learning to predict rainfall with high accuracy. The experience highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling class imbalances for effective model development.

Future Scope
Integrate real-time weather data for live predictions.
Use advanced algorithms like deep learning for further performance improvement.
Extend the project to predict rainfall intensity or other weather phenomena.
